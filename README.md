## ✉️ Feedback Form Integration

The feedback form is set up but does not send emails by default.
You can connect it using **EmailJS**:

1. Create an account at [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).
2. Set up a new service, template, and get your `SERVICE_ID`, `TEMPLATE_ID`, and `PUBLIC_KEY`.
3. Install EmailJS SDK:

   ```bash
   npm install emailjs-com
   ```

4. In your form component:

   ```javascript
   import emailjs from "emailjs-com";

   const sendEmail = (e) => {
     e.preventDefault();

     emailjs
       .sendForm(
         "YOUR_SERVICE_ID",
         "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID",
         e.target,
         "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
       )
       .then(
         (result) => {
           console.log(result.text);
           alert("Feedback sent successfully!");
         },
         (error) => {
           console.log(error.text);
           alert("Error sending feedback.");
         }
       );
   };
   ```

5. Replace the `<form>` tag with:

   ```html
   <form onSubmit="{sendEmail}"></form>
   ```

Would you like me to also **include sample environment variables** for EmailJS (like `.env.example`) so you don’t have to hardcode your API keys?
